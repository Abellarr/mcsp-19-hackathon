Hello to whomever might be reading this:

I chose to utilize the Bootstrap library to enhance the ability to quickly stylize and layout my html document without having the need to bog myself down with any CSS sheets (you'll probably notice there is no CSS file with this repository). The coding was almost completely done through the html file with some JS thrown in to add event triggers on the buttons on the page. I understand that this is a pretty simple page but, it didn't take me long to get Bootstrap up, running, and configuring with my html file.

I started with some documentation reading on Bootstrap's website and some YouTube video tutorials to help me start implementing it in my website (shoutout to 'The Net Ninja' for the awesome vids!). Once I got through a few videos and working Bootstrap's library onto my page, I began diving back into the documentation to try to figure some things out for myself. This seems like a pretty decent library to get designing and stylizing your website pretty quickly and, if I had a few more days to play with it, I'm sure I could get something sharp on the front-end.

*** Small word of caution: the Bootstrap library focuses first on mobile browsers, then on web browsers. It doesn't affect it's compatibility with the major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), just know that it looks first to fit/work with mobile browsers so sometimes the default settings will reflect this. If you're building something that you want to go on both (and who isn't?) then this will work very well. ***

To get this up and running, just right-click on the index.html file, click on Copy Path, then paste into your browser's address bar and check out what I've done. Just remember, the buttons are properly labeled so you don't need to click on all of them.
